# This is a list of servers used by mxmotor.
#
# Servers with only a single device, like a detector or a powerpmac,
# should go in their device specific .dat files
#
# Servers that have more than one device, like the id_a and id_d server,
# should go in this .dat file, to make it easier to access them, and also
# so that the server doesn't give an error if you reorder mxmotor imports
# or comment out a particular device.
#
# This file should be the first thing imported into mxmotor.
#
# Server description and locations:
# id_a - for A hutch devices, currently on top of D hutch
# id_d - for A and D hutch devices, currently on top of D hutch

# WARNING: The Powerpmacs use a very old version of MX, namely MX 1.5.5.  On
# this old version of MX, communication with a big-endian CPU such as the
# PowerPC CPUs used by the Powerpmacs made use of a special network format
# called XDR that was invented for Sun's NFS network file sharing.  Newer
# versions of MX dispense with the complexity of XDR and merely byteswap the
# data being sent to the MX server.  However, there is a backward compatibility
# flag (0x400) which can still be used to specifically request XDR format.
# That is what I have done in the database below.
