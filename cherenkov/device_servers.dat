# This is a list of servers used by mxmotor.
#
# Servers with only a single device, like a detector or a powerpmac,
# should go in their device specific .dat files
#
# Servers that have more than one device, like the id_a and id_d server,
# should go in this .dat file, to make it easier to access them, and also
# so that the server doesn't give an error if you reorder mxmotor imports
# or comment out a particular device.
#
# This file should be the first thing imported into mxmotor.
#
# Server description and locations:
# id_a - for A hutch devices, currently on top of D hutch
